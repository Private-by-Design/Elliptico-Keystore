Sensitive Data Protection and Automation Framework

PbD Elliptico is an end-to-end data encryption and access management framework that is aimed at covering the current GDPR requirements and at mitigating privacy and security risks. By applying a robust encryption philosophy and transparent key-management facilities, it elegantly solves the most common private and sensitive data scenarios. 

The idea for this project came in the beginning of 2017 as a friendly argument if GDPR can ever be feasibly covered within a real enterprise landscape with multiple Customer Touchpoints, Data Warehouses, Caching, Backups and etc. With the increasing demand for privacy and security it has slowly evolved into a full-scale framework design and will hopefully materialize within this Open-source project.
